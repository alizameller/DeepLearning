For this project, I worked with my classmate, David Stekol, on brainstorming ideas and working through the implementation of SIREN. 

fig.png is a compilation of the images used and produced in this assignment. trained_image.png is the 180 x 180 image produced by SIREN after training on TestcardF.jpeg (also 180 x 180). super_reolution.png is the 720 x 720 image produced by utilizing the trained model and feeding in pixel coordinates that span a 720 x 720 space. 

The super resolution image demonstrates the interpolation capabilities of the model which produces better results than the trained image zoomed in (to match this resolution). As seen in comparison.png, this is because the model produces a super-resoluted image that maintains the smooth edges of the original. The reason for the graininess in the image is because the interpolation is not perfect -- sometimes the RGB values are incorrect. However, despite the graininess, the image does display reduced pixelatedness which can be seen when zooming in to the smaller resolution one (this is how I obtained comparison.png). Further, I hypothesize that applying a "denoising" filter to the super resolution image will help produce even better results. I hope to continue to experiment with this going forward.
